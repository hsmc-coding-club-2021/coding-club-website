        <p>Come over, tell me 'bout it
            <br>
            Come closer, dance around what you wanted to say
            <br>

            <br>

            <br>
            'Til then, I'll hold onto you</p>

       <p>Woke up on the rooftop, layin' next to you
        <br>
        Don't know how we got here, baby, what a view
        <br>
        Hard to find the words, words, words, words
        <br>
        I just let it blur, blur, blur, blur
        <br>
        I've been runnin' too hot, need to play it cool
        <br>
        Drivin' on empty, cryin' in the coupe
        <br>
        Every time it hurts, hurts, hurts, hurts
        <br>
        I just let it blur, blur, blur, blur
        </p>

        <p> How can you say there was nothing wrong with us?
            <br>
            When everyday you called, you yelled, you had enough
            <br>
            I loved you more and more each time you slammed the door
            <br>
            My bloody knuckles knocking on and end up bruised
            <br>
            But I loved you less and less as my love turned to loneliness
            <br>
            And I'd already lost what I was afraid to lose
            <br>
            Now I'm in love without you
            <br>
            Please don't still love me
            <br>
            I'm in love without you
            <br>
            But you still find a way inside my dreams</p>
